# rusty-eth-cqrs

One day I'll come up with a better name. This is just for experimenting.

## TODOs

1. synchronization of token events with CQRS
2. Request / Response structs for rest API
3. Readside database of events for more complex queries
4. Automated / Load testing modules
5. IPFS for metadata management
6. GQL?
